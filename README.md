# Mathematical Models Repository

This repository contains implementations of various mathematical models, including attractors and more. Each model is implemented using Python and includes code for generating and visualizing the respective mathematical phenomenon.

# Introduction
Mathematical models play a crucial role in understanding and simulating complex phenomena in various fields. This repository serves as a collection of implemented mathematical models, providing a resource for learning, exploring, and experimenting with these models.

# Models
Currently, the following mathematical models are available in this repository:

Aizawa Attractor
Thomas Attractor
[Add more models as they are implemented]

Each model is accompanied by code for generating the model's trajectory and visualizing it using Python's libraries.
